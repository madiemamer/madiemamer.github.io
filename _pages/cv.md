Service work and Mentorship
=====
* Curriculum Development with Atlanta High School Instructor (Summer 2024/2025)
  * Through a Georgia Tech program, I am collaborating with my advisor and a local high school math instructor to design a comprehensive sea-level rise curriculum in line with state standards. This curriculum integrates real-world data from tide gauges and NOAA’s long-term global sea level rise dataset to provide students with hands-on experience in environmental science, fostering both mathematical and scientific literacy.

* American Geophysical Union Session Convener
  * Primary Convener for session “Linking Glaciers and Oceans through Fjords and Ice-Ocean Processes” (Fall 2025)
  * Early Career Convener for session “Physical and Biogeochemcial Processes on the Warm Antarctic Continental Shelves” (Fall 2025)
  * Early Career Convener for session “Ice-Ocean Interactions along Antarctica’s Continental Shelf” (Fall 2024)

* REU Mentor (Summer 2024)
  * Over the course of the summer, I worked with a local undergraduate from Spelman University exploring IceSat-2 elevation data across Antarctic Ice Shelf termini. The goal was to create an automatic system for detecting ‘rampart-moat’ structures at the edge of the ice shelf. This opportunity taught the undergraduate about ice sheet science, remote sensing data, and how to code in Python.

* Climate and Sustainability Workshop Organizer (Fall 2023)
  * As a member of the organizing committee, I helped coordinate a 5-day workshop on climate science, justice, and solutions at Spelman College. The event brought together a diverse group of researchers, policy scientists, and grassroots organizations to foster interdisciplinary discussions on climate solutions and the equitable distribution of environmental resources.

* Undergraduate Research Mentor (Fall 2023)
  * I mentored a Georgia Tech undergraduate student in a research project that combines observational data and computational modeling techniques to better understand ocean surface wave erosion of icebergs. This mentorship involves hands-on guidance in research methodology, data analysis, and scientific communication.

Advanced Trainings
=====
* Beyond the Ice Edge: Linking Science and Society in Greenland’s Coastal Margins
  Greenland Ice Sheet and Ocean Science Network Summer School, Nuuk, Greenland
  September 2024
  This two-week program in Nuuk explored Greenland’s research strategy, emphasizing the connection between science and local communities. I was able to engage with researchers and locals, gaining insights into the challenges facing Greenland’s coastal margins. The experience also provided me with a deeper understanding of Greenlandic culture and the role of science in addressing environmental and socio-economic issues in the Arctic.

* Fluid Dynamics of Sustainability and the Environment
  Summer School, École Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France
  May 2024
  This two-week summer school at École Polytechnique focused on the fundamental theory of fluid dynamics and its application to renewable energy and geophysical research. I gained in-depth knowledge of how fluid dynamics principles are applied to sustainable technologies and environmental challenges. The program provided me with a multidisciplinary perspective, exploring topics such as energy efficiency, ocean currents, and climate modeling, and fostering a deeper understanding of the role of fluid dynamics in advancing environmental sustainability.
