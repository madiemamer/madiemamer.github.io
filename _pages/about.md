Hi there — thanks for visiting!

I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Tech, where I work with Dr. Alex Robel on work surrounding ice-ocean interactions. My research focuses on fluid dynamics across a wide range of scales, from centimeters to kilometers, with an interest in buoyancy-driven flows primarily in polar regions.

My dissertation research explores how glacial meltwater interacts with the ocean, focusing on small-scale mixing dynamics and meltwater feedback processes. I use both high-resolution models of complex flows and simplified models that connect small-scale processes to large-scale ocean behavior. My work combines numerical modeling with new theoretical approaches to understand how “warm”, salty ocean water reaches and melts glacial ice — a key process controlling the mass balance of Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets.

I’m passionate about building and refining models, learning new coding languages, and developing tools that help us explore physical systems. In this pursuit, I also prioritize science communication and visualization to make complex models and climate-related topics more accessible to the broader public.
